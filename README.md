# Personalized-plan-ai
Integrated an AI-powered personalized recovery plan system into the Soul Support app using a trained Decision Tree model. The AI interprets users' psychological test results and generates customized mental health plans in real time.
# ðŸ¤– Personalized AI Recovery Plan â€“ Soul Support App Module

This module powers the core AI feature in the **Soul Support** mental health app. It takes psychological test responses from users and generates a tailored recovery plan using a trained **Decision Tree Machine Learning model**.

## ðŸ’¡ Goal
To provide users with **customized, evidence-based recovery recommendations** based on their mental health assessments (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress). The goal is to eliminate one-size-fits-all content and create a plan **unique to each userâ€™s emotional state**.

## ðŸ§¬ How It Works

1. ðŸ§ª The user completes a series of psychological self-assessment tests (multiple choice / Likert scale).
2. ðŸ“Š Their answers are processed into numerical features.
3. ðŸ§  A trained **Decision Tree Classifier** (built in Python) predicts a mental state category.
4. ðŸ“‹ Based on the prediction, a custom plan is generated:
   - Daily self-care tasks
   - Journaling prompts
   - Breathing exercises
   - Affirmations
   - Referral to a therapist (if severe)
